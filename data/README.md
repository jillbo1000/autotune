## grid_data
Contains the data files that hold all of the information for the grid search. These data files are called directly in the creation of Figures 1 and 2 that show the response surface for both error rate and time, and for the Appendix B performance tables. The organization and content of these files is self explanatory. 

## optimization_data
Data from the tests of the different optimization algorithms. These are the data used to create Figures 3-7. The organization and content of these files is self explanatory.
