# autotune_files
Code for the paper "Tuning support vector machines and boosted trees using optimization algorithms" in the Journal of Data Science

Each directory is outlined below and each of the directories contains a readme that explains the files in the subfolders. 

## data directory
The data directory contains the data files used to do the research, the 
grid search results, the optimization test results, and the EZtune test 
results. 

## scripts directory
The scripts directory contains the scripts used to create the figures in the 
paper and the performance tables in the supplementary material. These files
are numbered to match the figures and tables in the paper. 

This folder also contains the scripts used to load and format the data for 
streamlined computation, a set of helpful functions used in the table
and plot creation, and some example computation files that demonstrate how
the grid search, optimization tests, and the EZtune verification were done. 

## plots directory
Contains the plots from the paper as generated by the scripts in this 
repository. 

## tables directory
Contains the tables as created by the performance table scripts. A text and a 
latex coded table is included.
